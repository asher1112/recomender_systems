# This project is based on various designs for recomender systems algorithms.

The data is based on rating.csv from the movielens dataset which can be found [https://www.kaggle.com/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset)

In this project the data is contained in a seperate folder called data in the previous directory.

## Preprocessing

The first step is to run preprocessing.ipynb which will preprocess the data for the models for each of the models.

the number of movies and users can be varied to get different results for the algorithms

## The algorithms

### User-User collabarative filtering

Test the algorithm for user user collabarative filtering

The hyperparameter for number of nearest neibours can be varied to test the results in different scenarios.

### Item Item collabarative filtering

The number of nearest neigbhours can be varied

### Matrix Factorisation

the hyperparameters are regulization and number of epochs, these can be varied to get different results
